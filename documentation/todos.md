# Email Dashboard Enhancement TODO List

## Priority Components to Implement

### 1. Response Time by Hour Component
**Purpose**: Visualize response time patterns throughout the day to identify peak performance periods and bottlenecks.

**Implementation Details**:
- Group hours into logical business periods:
  - Early Morning: 06:00-09:00
  - Morning: 09:00-13:00  
  - Afternoon: 13:00-17:00
  - Evening: 17:00-21:00
  - Night: 21:00-06:00
- Display average response times for each time block
- Show volume of emails responded to in each period
- Use color coding (green/yellow/red) based on SLA thresholds
- Include business hours overlay from SLA config (7:00-18:00)

**Visual Format**: Horizontal bar chart or heat map

### 2. Response Time Distribution Component
**Purpose**: Categorize all responses by speed to understand overall performance distribution.

**Categories**:
- Very Fast: â‰¤15 minutes (Green)
- Fast: 16-60 minutes (Light Green)  
- Moderate: 1-4 hours (Yellow)
- Slow: 4-8 hours (Orange)
- Very Slow: 8-24 hours (Red)
- Critical: >24 hours (Dark Red)

**Display Elements**:
- Count and percentage for each category
- Visual progress bars showing proportion
- SLA compliance indicator (responses within 120min threshold)
- Total volume summary

**Visual Format**: Horizontal progress bars with labels and percentages

### 3. Response Time Percentile Component  
**Purpose**: Show statistical distribution of response times for performance analysis.

**Percentiles to Display**:
- P25 (25th percentile): 25% of emails responded faster than this time
- P50 (50th percentile/Median): Half of emails responded faster 
- P75 (75th percentile): 75% of emails responded faster
- P90 (90th percentile): 90% of emails responded faster
- P95 (95th percentile): 95% of emails responded faster

**Additional Metrics**:
- Count of emails in each quartile
- Comparison to SLA target (60min from config)
- Trend indicator (compared to previous period)

**Visual Format**: Box plot or percentile ladder chart

## Additional Dashboard Components to Consider

### 4. AI Analysis Cards
**Purpose**: Provide intelligent insights and analysis of daily email performance.

**Components**:
- Daily performance summary with key insights
- Anomaly detection (unusual response times or volumes)
- Trend analysis comparing to previous periods
- Actionable recommendations for improvement
- Performance highlights and concerns

**Visual Format**: Card-based layout at bottom of dashboard with AI-generated text analysis

### 5. Email Volume Patterns
- Incoming vs Outgoing email counts by hour
- Busiest time periods identification
- Volume vs response time correlation analysis

### 6. Top Response Time Offenders  
- Emails taking longest to respond
- Sender/category analysis for chronic delays
- Actionable insights for process improvement

### 7. Weekly Team Performance Tracking
**Purpose**: Track group performance trends over time without individual identification.

**Components**:
- Weekly average response times (group level only)
- Week-over-week performance trends
- Group performance against SLA targets
- Collective improvement/decline indicators

**Note**: No individual performance tracking - only aggregated team metrics

## Implementation Priority Order
1. **High Priority**: Components 1-3 (Response time analysis suite)
2. **Medium Priority**: Component 4 (AI Analysis Cards), Component 5 (Email Volume Patterns)
3. **Low Priority**: Components 6-7 (Advanced analytics and team tracking)

## Weekly Dashboard Components (Separate Implementation)
- SLA Compliance Trends (daily/weekly compliance percentage with trending charts)
- Weekly team performance summaries
- Week-over-week comparative analysis

## Technical Notes
- All components should respect the existing SLA configuration in `/config/sla_config.json`
- Integrate with current dashboard generation pipeline in `/dashboard/scripts/generate_dashboard.py`
- Use consistent color scheme and visual styling
- Ensure responsive design for various screen sizes
- Add data export capabilities for deeper analysis

## Data Requirements
- Email timestamp data with precision to minutes
- Response/reply matching logic
- Business hours calculation capability  
- Historical data retention for trend analysis
