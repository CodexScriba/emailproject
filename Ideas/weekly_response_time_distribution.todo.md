# Weekly Response Time Distribution Todo

## User Stories
- As a leadership team member, I want to see aggregated weekly response time performance so I can assess team efficiency across longer time periods
- As a manager, I want to identify response time patterns over a full week so I can spot trends and areas for improvement
- As an executive, I want visual confirmation of SLA compliance trends so I can make data-driven decisions about team performance
- As a stakeholder, I want consistent visual design with daily dashboards so I can easily understand the metrics without learning new layouts

## Phase 1: Data Processing Foundation
- [x] Analyze existing daily dashboard data structure for `response_time_distribution`
- [x] Examine `weekly/scripts/generate_weekly_dashboard.py` to understand current data processing flow
- [x] Identify where weekly aggregation logic should be implemented
- [x] Design data aggregation function to combine 7 days of response time data
- [x] Implement response time categorization logic for weekly data:
  - Lightning Fast: Under 30 minutes
  - Fast Response: 30-60 minutes
  - Moderate: 60-120 minutes
  - Slow: 120-180 minutes
  - Very Slow: 180-300 minutes
  - Critical: Over 300 minutes
- [x] Add percentage calculation for each category relative to total weekly emails
- [x] Test data aggregation with existing database entries

## Phase 2: Template Integration
- [x] Examine existing `weekly/dashboard/templates/weekly_kpi_cards.html` structure
- [x] Identify optimal placement below "Weekly 2-Hour Email Metrics" section
- [x] Study daily dashboard response time distribution card for design reference
- [x] Copy and adapt the HTML structure from daily template
- [x] Ensure Jinja2 template variables are properly mapped for weekly data
- [x] Maintain exact same emoji usage: ⚡ 🚀 ⏱️ 🐢 ⚠️ 🔴
- [x] Preserve all CSS class names for visual consistency
- [x] Adapt card title to "Weekly Response Time Distribution"
- [x] Update data display format to show "X emails" instead of daily counts

## Phase 3: Visual Design Consistency
- [x] Copy exact CSS styling from daily dashboard response time card
- [x] Ensure Inter font family consistency across all text elements
- [x] Maintain same color scheme:
  - Success colors (green) for Lightning Fast and Fast Response
  - Warning colors (orange) for Moderate and Slow
  - Danger colors (red) for Very Slow and Critical
- [x] Preserve gradient bar animations and hover effects
- [x] Keep shimmer effects and transform animations on hover
- [x] Ensure responsive design works on mobile devices
- [x] Maintain accessibility features (titles, aria-labels)
- [x] Test visual consistency by comparing side-by-side with daily dashboard

## Phase 4: Integration & Testing
- [x] Integrate new card into weekly dashboard generation workflow
- [x] Update `generate_weekly_dashboard.py` to pass aggregated data to template
- [x] Test with actual database data across multiple weeks
- [x] Verify percentage calculations are accurate
- [x] Ensure card displays properly in different screen sizes
- [x] Validate that all six performance categories display correctly
- [x] Test with edge cases (weeks with no emails, weeks with only one category)
- [x] Generate sample weekly dashboard and verify placement and styling
- [x] Document any configuration changes needed in the system

### Data Integration Points
- **Source**: `database/email_database.json`
- **Processor**: `weekly/scripts/generate_weekly_dashboard.py`
- **Template**: `weekly/dashboard/templates/weekly_kpi_cards.html`
- **Output**: `weekly/dashboard/output/weekly_dashboard_*.html`

### Required Dependencies
- **pandas**: For data aggregation and processing (≥1.5.0)
- **numpy**: For numerical operations (≥1.24.0)
- **jinja2**: For template rendering (≥3.1.0)

### Performance Considerations
- Aggregate data processing should be efficient for large datasets
