# Project Tasks

Specific implementation tasks organized by todo objectives.

## ✅ Calculate missing response time data for Complete_List_Raw.csv

**Priority: HIGH** - ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Analyze Complete_List_Raw.csv structure vs Reserve.csv structure
- [x] Identify why Complete_List_Raw.csv only contains "Inbox" events  
- [x] Research if "Replied" and "Completed" events exist in other data sources
- [x] Create algorithm to estimate response times from available data
- [x] Cross-reference with DailySummary.csv response time data (2 days available)
- [x] Implement business hours response time calculation in minutes
- [x] Validate calculated response times against actual event patterns
- [x] Document data limitations and confidence levels for calculations

**Results:** Email classification system successfully matches 262 inbox emails with replies/completions, calculating business-hour response times. 59.16% reply rate, 65.2 min average response time.

## ✅ Hourly Email Distribution Analysis

**Priority: MEDIUM** - ✅ COMPLETED  

- [x] Analyze email volume by hour of day (0-23)
- [x] Generate hourly distribution statistics and percentages
- [x] Identify peak email hours for capacity planning
- [x] Output hourly analysis to `results/Hourly_Email_Distribution.csv`

**Results:** Peak email hour identified as 12:00 PM with 35 emails. Complete 24-hour distribution analysis available for dashboard integration.

## Build daily dashboard with 4 KPI cards and hourly visualization

**Priority: HIGH** - Core deliverable for leadership

### Hourly Visualization
- [ ] Create side-by-side bar chart HTML/CSS structure
- [ ] Implement blue bars for emails received per hour (from Complete_List_Raw timestamps)
- [ ] Add red bars for unread emails per hour (from UnreadCount.csv)
- [ ] Ensure responsive design for email distribution
- [ ] Add clear legends and time labels (7 AM - 9 PM)

### Dashboard Template
- [ ] Adapt modern_dashboard.html design patterns
- [ ] Apply professional slate/blue color palette
- [ ] Create CSS-only progress bars and status badges
- [ ] Implement single-file HTML structure for email compatibility
- [ ] Add executive summary section with key insights

## Create Python data processing pipeline

**Priority: HIGH** - Required for dashboard generation

### Data Processing Scripts
- [ ] Create CSV parser for UnreadCount.csv (hourly SLA data)
- [ ] Build timestamp processor for Complete_List_Raw.csv
- [ ] Implement DailySummary.csv data extractor
- [ ] Create data validation and quality checks
- [ ] Build correlation analyzer between datasets

### Dashboard Generation
- [ ] Create HTML template engine for daily dashboard
- [ ] Implement data-to-visualization converter (CSS-based charts)
- [ ] Build automated KPI calculation engine
- [ ] Create email-ready HTML output generator
- [ ] Add error handling for missing or corrupt data

### Data Pipeline
- [ ] Design modular script architecture
- [ ] Create data cleaning and preprocessing modules
- [ ] Implement daily dashboard generation workflow
- [ ] Add logging and monitoring capabilities
- [ ] Create configuration system for thresholds and settings

## Build global dashboard for historical data analysis

**Priority: MEDIUM** - Strategic insights for leadership

### Historical Analysis Features
- [ ] Create 3-month volume trend analysis from DailySummary.csv
- [ ] Build correlation analysis between unread counts and available response times
- [ ] Implement data quality assessment dashboard
- [ ] Create pattern identification for time-of-day trends
- [ ] Design completion rate analysis over time

### Visualization Components
- [ ] Build trend line charts using CSS-only approach
- [ ] Create data gap visualization to highlight tracking system issues
- [ ] Implement correlation matrices for available metrics
- [ ] Add period-over-period comparison features
- [ ] Design executive summary of data quality issues

### Integration
- [ ] Link daily and global dashboards
- [ ] Create navigation between different views
- [ ] Implement consistent design language across dashboards
- [ ] Add export capabilities for leadership presentations

## ✅ Project Organization and Infrastructure

**Priority: MEDIUM** - ✅ COMPLETED

### Directory Structure
- [x] Create `scripts/` directory for all Python code
- [x] Create `results/` directory for generated outputs  
- [x] Move `email_classifier.py` from root to `scripts/`
- [x] Separate data sources (`data/`) from generated results (`results/`)
- [x] Implement proper project organization for scalability

### Development Infrastructure
- [x] Create comprehensive `.gitignore` for Python projects
- [x] Ignore virtual environment, cache files, and IDE artifacts
- [x] Update all file paths for new directory structure
- [x] Test script functionality from new location

**Results:** Clean project structure with separate `scripts/`, `results/`, and `data/` directories. All dependencies properly ignored in version control.
