# Decisions
- Implemented dynamic scaling for hourly bar chart in `dashboard/templates/kpi_cards.html`.
- Added CSS var `--chart-height` and overflow visibility to prevent cropping.
- Adjusted Y-axis label generation to match the dynamic scale.
- Added a new "Relations" section to `documentation/architecture.md` mapping file dependencies.
- Completed dashboard generation pipeline with dynamic SVG charts.
- Updated architecture documentation to reflect complete dashboard system.
- Summarized and simplified `documentation/architecture.md` for readability without removing information.

# Context & Details
- Issue: 5 PM and 6 PM bars were clipped due to fixed 300px plotting area and inline bar heights (e.g., 300px/318px).
- Fix: JS reads `.bar-value` numbers, computes `yMax` with 10% headroom, scales all bar heights to fit `--chart-height`.
- Y-axis labels now auto-update from 0 to `yMax`. Supports larger counts (e.g., 80) without cropping.
- Updated documentation to clarify how `daily/scripts/`, `email_database.json`, `dashboard/templates/`, and `dashboard/output/` relate.
- Dashboard generation pipeline now fully functional with automated SVG coordinate calculations.
- Produced executive-style summary of `documentation/architecture.md` preserving key numerics (88 days, 1,303 SLA records, 459KB DB, 262 emails, 68.58% SLA, Aug 13 metrics).
- Flagged potential constraint mismatch: architecture says "No JavaScript" while notes mention JS scaling in chartsâ€”confirm intended constraint.

# Open
- Dashboard generation pipeline is now complete and working.
- Confirm "No JavaScript" constraint vs any JS present in templates; update documentation or implementation accordingly.

# Next
- Focus on historical analysis dashboard features.
- Consider enhancements for multi-day dashboard comparison.
- If "No JavaScript" stands, port any chart scaling logic to Python/SVG generation and remove JS.
- Optionally create a stakeholder one-pager derived from the summary.
