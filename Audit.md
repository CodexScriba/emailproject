## 2. Data Flow Verification

### Data Pipeline Analysis

#### Stage 1: Raw Data Input
- **Sources:** `Complete_List_Raw.csv` and `UnreadCount.csv`
- **Finding:** CSV files contain properly formatted email conversation and unread count data
- **Verification:** Sample data inspected, headers and data types confirmed

#### Stage 2: Email Classification
- **Process:** `email_classifier.py` processes conversations
- **Classification Logic:**
  - Priority 1: Replied (if reply event found)
  - Priority 2: Completed (if marked complete)
  - Priority 3: Pending (default)
- **Finding:** ✅ Classification logic correctly implemented and follows documented rules

#### Stage 3: Response Time Calculation
- **Business Hours:** Configurable via `config/sla_config.json` (default 7 AM – 9 PM, Monday–Friday)
- **Calculation:** Only minutes within the configured business hours are counted between receipt and response
- **Finding:** ✅ Business hours calculation correctly excludes weekends and non-business hours

#### Stage 4: Unified Database Generation
- **Output:** `email_database.json` with multi-day aggregated data
- **Structure:** Metadata + daily data arrays with hourly metrics
- **Finding:** ✅ Database structure matches documentation, contains 88 days of data

#### Stage 5: Dashboard Generation
- **Process:** `generate_dashboard.py` reads JSON and renders template
- **Date:** Dashboard generated for August 13, 2025 (as per sample data)
- **Finding:** ✅ Template rendering produces valid HTML with correct data binding
