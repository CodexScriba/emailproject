## 🔮 Staffing Analytics Concepts

### **Simple Daily Staffing Insights**
*Based on daily agent count data*

#### **Basic Staffing Metrics**
```
┌─────────────────────┐  ┌─────────────────────┐  
│ Agents Working      │  │ Emails per Agent    │  
│      6              │  │     45.3            │  
│ Same as yesterday   │  │ Higher than average │  
└─────────────────────┘  └─────────────────────┘  
```

**Core Concept**: Simple correlation between daily agent count and email performance
- Daily agent count display
- Basic workload distribution (emails ÷ agents)
- Day-over-day staffing comparison

#### **Staffing vs Performance Visualization**
**Big Picture Idea**: Add agent count as context to existing charts
- Third line on hourly chart showing daily agent count (flat line)
- Visual correlation between staffing levels and SLA performance
- Simple color coding: green (adequate staffing), red (understaffed)

### **Weekly Staffing Patterns**
*Conceptual weekly analysis*

#### **Staffing Correlation Dashboard**
**Vision**: Understand how agent count affects performance across days

```
Weekly Staffing Overview (Aug 12-18, 2025)
═══════════════════════════════════════════

📊 STAFFING PATTERNS
   • Monday (8 agents): 94% SLA compliance
   • Tuesday (6 agents): 72% SLA compliance  
   • Wednesday (5 agents): 45% SLA compliance
   • Peak Performance: 7+ agents needed for 85%+ SLA

💡 INSIGHTS
   • Low staffing days correlate with poor SLA
   • Optimal range appears to be 7-8 agents
   • Weekends may need different staffing model
```
